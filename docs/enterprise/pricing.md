## Why Organizations Choose the Starter Kit

### ⚡ Speed to Production
"We went from contract signature to production deployment in 11 days. The pre-configured compliance policies alone saved us 6 weeks of legal review."

### 💰 Total Cost of Ownership
Compare the Starter Kit to building in-house:
- **Security Framework**: 3-6 months of security engineering = $150K-300K
- **Compliance Configuration**: 2-4 months of compliance work = $100K-200K
- **Integration Development**: 2-3 months of backend development = $80K-150K
- **Testing & Hardening**: 1-2 months of QA and pentesting = $50K-100K

**Total DIY Cost**: $380K-750K + 8-15 months

**Starter Kit**: Fraction of the cost + under 2 weeks to production

### 🔒 Enterprise-Grade Security
Built by security engineers who've deployed AI systems in regulated industries. Every component undergoes regular security audits and penetration testing.
